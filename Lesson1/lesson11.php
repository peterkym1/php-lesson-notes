//In development we often need to store data collected from users of our systems
//MySQL is the database base system used for both big and small businesses and it uses
//the SQL (structured query Language) to interact with data
//A Db is made up of related tables

//before using the database you have to connect to it by providing the following info
//        1.hostname
//        2.username
//        3.password
//        4.database name
